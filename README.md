SocialDocumentary
=================

Social Documentary is an artistic installation to navigate in a collection of crowd-sourced videos. Those videos are related to the events that happened at Gezi Park (Istanbul) in June 2013.
The visitors are invited to interact with the installation by choosing keywords through the manipulation of three cubes. Each cube represents a class of keywords (people, action, emotion). As the videos are cut into segments and tagged with the same keywords, the system will automatically choose the most relevant video according to the position of the cubes. A Kinect-based system allows us to track the two closest visitorsâ€™ faces and infer on their interest for the played video. The more the visitors are interested, the higher is the probability to display this video to the next visitors, as recommendation system on video broadcast platforms. In this way, the installation evolves with its public. Some segments will emerge from the others as the "most popular".
