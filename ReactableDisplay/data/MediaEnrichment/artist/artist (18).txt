Shahzia Sikander at the 13th Istanbul Biennial | "Artist to Artist" | Art21. Shahzia Sikander travels to the 13th Istanbul Biennial and speaks with four fellow artists and a two-person design collective about their projects. "There's so much within the art world that happens by word of mouth, by engaging, by making a connection," says Sikander. Artists address not only the concepts that underlie their work, but also the public protests in Gezi Park and Taksim Square—also known as the Gezi Resistance—that began three months before the Biennial opened and impacted its organization. Sikander discusses the palpability of social unrest in Istanbul and describes an "energy and anxiousness" that would occasionally erupt. Diego Bianchi, Gülsün Karamustafa, Basim Magdy, Hito Steyerl, and RAAAF (formerly Rietveld Landscape) are also featured in the film. The 13th Istanbul Biennial was on view September 14--October 20, 2013. Learn more about "Artist to Artist" at: "Artist to Artist" Created & Produced by: Ian Forster. Director: David Howe.
