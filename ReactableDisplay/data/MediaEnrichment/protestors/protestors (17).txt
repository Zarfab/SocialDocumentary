Turkish police fire tear gas at demonstrators outside an Istanbul hospital. Turkish police have clashed with demonstrators angry at the death of a teenager who had suffered a head injury during last summer's anti-government rallies. Police have used tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of protesters in the cities of Istanbul and Ankara. Crowds took to the streets, following the death of 15-year-old Birkin Elvan in a hospital in Istanbul. He died, nine months after he was wounded during street fighting between police and protesters in the city. Elvan was on his way home when he was struck in the head by a tear-gas canister and went into a coma. He's among a number of people killed during anti-government protests which gripped Turkey last summer. Those rallies broke out after the government destroyed an Istanbul park for a construction project.
