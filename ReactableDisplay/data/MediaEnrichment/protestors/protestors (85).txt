Turkey Protests - Taksim Gezi Park - My Unjust Protector. Music: Midnight Moodswings - "My Unjust Protector" (Composed to support the protest) Turkey is witnessing a historical protest against the government. It started in Taksim as a peaceful protest against building a shopping center in the place of a beautiful park, but then police came and brutally shot people with tear gasses and pressured water to scare the protesters, some people died. The protest has quickly spread all around the country. Hundreds of thousands of people protested in 90 different places. The police forces can't handle the situation, they just beat people and use too much tear gasses and pressured water. They arrest lots of innocent people. This government can't stand in its current mindset. Consider spreading the word. Informative links: With arms in arms, and empathy in our brain. One day we will sleep again. Oh surviving virtues of my suffocating times, One day we will sleep again.
