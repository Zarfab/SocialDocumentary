Anger in Istanbul over Dink murder trial. Demonstrators in Istanbul marched in anger over the conviction of a second man for the killing, five years ago of a prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist. The family of Hrant Dink denounced the verdict, arguing the murder was a political assassination. Nineteen other defendants, known to be Turkish nationalists were acquitted of being members of a terrorist organisation. One protester said: "This case is a disaster.Those who committed this organised crime were dealt with as if it was just an ordinary murder."
